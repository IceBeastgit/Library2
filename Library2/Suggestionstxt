Certainly! Here are some test case suggestions that you can consider for testing a `Library` class:

1. **Test Case: Find Book by Title ID**
   - Test that you can successfully retrieve a book by its title ID.
   - For example, try to find "Lord of the Rings" using its title ID ("BK1").

2. **Test Case: Find Nonexistent Book by Title ID**
   - Test that attempting to retrieve a book with a nonexistent title ID returns the expected result (e.g., null or a special indicator).

3. **Test Case: Check If Book Is Borrowed**
   - Test that you can correctly determine if a book is currently borrowed.
   - Borrow a book (set its borrowed status to true) and check if the library correctly reports that the book is borrowed.

4. **Test Case: Check If Book Is Available**
   - Test that you can correctly determine if a book is available for borrowing.
   - Return a borrowed book (set its borrowed status to false) and check if the library correctly reports that the book is available.

5. **Test Case: Borrow Book**
   - Test the borrowing functionality.
   - Borrow a book and verify that the book's borrowed status is set to true.

6. **Test Case: Return Book**
   - Test the returning functionality.
   - Return a borrowed book and verify that the book's borrowed status is set to false.

7. **Test Case: Find Books by Author**
   - Test that you can retrieve a list of books by a specific author.
   - For example, find all books by "J.R.R. Tolkien" and ensure the correct books are returned.

8. **Test Case: Check Library Is Empty Initially**
   - Test that the library is empty initially before any books are added.

9. **Test Case: Check Library Is Not Empty After Adding Books**
   - Test that the library is not empty after adding books to it.

10. **Test Case: Add Book to Library**
    - Test that you can successfully add a new book to the library.
    - After adding a book, verify that the library contains the expected number of books.

These test cases cover various aspects of a library management system, including book retrieval, borrowing, returning, searching, and basic functionality. You can expand or modify these test cases based on the specific requirements and features of your `Library` class.
